# Count characters in your string

The main idea is a program that counts all the occurences of characters(UTF-8) in string. 

Example:

```ruby

   count_chars("aba") => { 'a': 2, 'b': 1 }

```

If the string is empty, the function returns an empty object literal.

Example:

```ruby

  count_chars("") => { }
  
```
